## Octotree
Browser extension (Chrome, Firefox, Opera and Safari) to show a code tree on GitHub. Awesome for exploring project source without having to pull every single repository to your machine. Features:

## Manually installing as a chrome extension

1. Clone this repo to your local machine
1. Navigate to the [Chrome Extensions menu](chrome://extensions/)
1. Turn on Developer mode
1. Select "Load unpacked"
1. Navigate to the `tmp/chrome` folder, which should contain the `manifest.json` file, and press select
1. The extension should then load into chrome and work as expected!
